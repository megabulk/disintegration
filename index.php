<h1>Postal Child</h1>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p>The next two days for Whitey were of unprecedented success. He spent three hours rummaging through Jonx and Brandy's apartment finding any piece of mail and document he could find. He put them in a plastic grocery bag. He went downstairs to his moms apartment and did the same. Whitey went outside. He went to the corner, to the check cashing place. He spent ten dollars on a roll of quarters. He went back outside and crossed the street. Whitey found a pay phone.</p>

<p>He had called both EBT, and the HRA. EBT had given him the password to Jonx and Brandy's card, which meant he now got $210 a month from them, he also found his mom's card in a drawer in the kitchen, which he already knew the password to, which meant he got another $210 per month.</p>

<p>The HRA was a little more difficult because they give you cash, but Whitey was able to talk them into changing both the check from Brandy and Jonx, and the check addressed to his mom, into his name. He had told them on both separate occasions that his father had jumped ship, and he was now the head of the household. They were used to that, and this meant another $630 a month in cash.</p>

<p>To top it off, rent was nonexistent. The building they lived in, well Whitey and the three dead bodies, was across the street from the project housing, so it fell under New York Housing laws that said that any house or building within two hundred feet of any said Project Housing was legally under ownership of the New York Department of Housing and therefore was mandated to follow all rules pertaining to land remitted to the New York Department of Housing.</p>

<p>Which meant: free rent for all those surrounding the projects.</p>

<p>Which meant: Whitey had $420 a month for food, $630 a month in cash, and no rent. He was the richest person in a two mile radius.</p>

<p>After the phone calls he had two quarters left. He crossed the street again and went into the deli. Whitey bought two sleeves of twenty five cent gumballs. Rainbow flavored. He popped a pink one in his mouth , he put the rest in his pocket and headed back home.</p>

<p>When Whitey opened the door there were now four pigeons in the apartment. He smiled and blew a bubble. He shut the door behind himself and went to the kitchen. He took two slices of bread out of the bag and walked over to the couch. The birds were standing on the coffee table. He tore the bread into pieces. Whitey put it on the plate. He sat down on the couch. Before long he was asleep.
The next morning Whitey woke up to the pigeons roosting on his chest. All four. He still had the bubble gum in his mouth. He wanted to get rid of it, but he didn't want to wake the birds. He swallowed it and went back to sleep.</p>

<p>An hour later Whitey woke up and the pigeons were gone. He stood up and stretched. He went into the kitchen and made himself a cheese sandwich. As he was eating his sandwich he looked down and noticed he was covered in shit. This made him aware that he only had a heel of bread left. He thought about this. I need more shirts and more bread, he thought. Whitey walked quickly towards the front door. He stopped. Something was wrong. Somethings wrong, he thought. He couldn't figure out what it was. He looked around and tried to process. He licked his teeth. His teeth were covered in scum. That's it! He thought. He had a flash of his mother yelling at him for not brushing his teeth. He went to the bathroom to brush his teeth.</p>

<p>As Whitey brushed his teeth he looked in the mirror. He could see the bird shit on his shirt. He spit into the sink. He took his shirt off and turned it inside out. He put it back on. He looked into the mirror again. He looked ok as far as he could tell. He went outside.</p>

<p>The super market was five blocks away. Whitey took the shortcut through the projects. He ran into one of the pigeons on the way. Whitey said hi. She road on his shoulder for a while. She rode on his shoulder until she shit on him. Whitey jerked his shoulder. She flew up. He wiped the shit off. Whitey wasn't pissed, but he said sternly:</p>

<p>“You guys can't shit on me! We gotta agree! We gotta agree! We gotta agree!” The pigeon flew away feeling guilty.</p>

<p>When Whitey got to the super market he was feeling like a jerk. He didn't mean to yell, but he had. He took a cart and pushed it down the aisles. He felt foolish. He didn't want to hurt his friends feelings. He loaded the cart with eighteen bags of bread, one three pound chunk of cheese, as well as a gallon of mayonaise.</p>

<p>When he checked out he paid with his moms EBT card. Fifty three dollars and fifty seven cents. The cashier couldn't understand what such a young kid needed with so much bread, but she said nothing, and Whitey looked like a bloated airplane as he walked out of the store.</p>

<p>The cheese and mayonaise made him stop every thirty steps. He was exhausted when he got home.</p>

<p>The walk up the stairs was too much. He dropped everything by the entrance and took it up by parcel. It took six trips. He stacked it all by front door to the apartment. When he opened the door to the apartment there might as well have been a surprise party. There were birds everywhere! Hundreds of them! Whitey couldn't have been happier! He didn't know what to do, so he grabbed a bag of bread and ripped it open! He threw the crumbs up in the air and spun around! The pigeon that had hurt his feelings flew over onto his shoulder. Whitey said he was sorry, the pigeon rubbed his beak on Whitey's face. Whitey smiled and drug the rest of the groceries into the apartment and slammed the door.</p>
